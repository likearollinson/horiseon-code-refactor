# UNC HW 1 - Code Refactor

This application is a refactor of code that was given. The goal of this refactoring was to make the html have a more clear and concise structure and to consolidate the css. The refactoring included making sure the structure of the html elements followed a logical structure, creating alt attributes for the images to be screen reader accessible, and updating the title to something more descriptive. This exercise was mainly used to practice the basics of html and css. Also refactored was the way the header is fixed when scrolling, and darkening the 'seo' in Horiseon so it is more noticeable.
